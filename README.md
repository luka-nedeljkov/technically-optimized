[![Built on Fabulously Optimized](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/built-with/fabulously-optimized_64h.png)](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized)

Technically Optimized is a remix of Fabulously Optimized with some additions like Masa's mods and Gnembon's Carpet mod. I made this for personal use, but feel free to give it a whirl.

Masa's mods and WorldEdit are not on Modrinth yet. I will use Curseforge for those mods in the meantime.
